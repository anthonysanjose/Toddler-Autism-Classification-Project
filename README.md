**Toddler Autism Classification Project**

*Abstract:*

Autism is a development disorder that impairs the individual’s ability to communicate and interact with others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC determined that 1 in 54 children are affected by Autism. This analysis would be a classification problem where the toddler’s ten behavioral features, gender, ethnicity, jaundice and family history are used to determine if the toddler has autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). I used Jupyter Notebook for this project. In Jupyter Notebook I utilized the Seaborn data visualization toolkit to determine which are the key factors with the Correlation Matrix and Heatmap Diagram. Then I would use the scikit-learn toolkit to apply the classification machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, naive bayes, k nearest neighbor, classification tree, neural network and discriminant analysis to the dataset. Next, I would perform an accuracy analysis to determine which algorithm was the most accurate and present it with a bar graph. Afterwards I would come up with a brand-new toddler’s data and predict if they would have autistic spectrum disorder (ASD).
